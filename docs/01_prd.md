**Product Requirements Document: Marcus's Custom Bicycle E-commerce Platform**

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** April 16, 2025
**Author:** Roman Borysenok
**Status:** Draft

**1. Introduction / Overview**

This document outlines the requirements for a new e-commerce website for "Marcus's Bicycle Shop." Marcus currently runs a successful physical store specializing in highly customizable bicycles. The primary goal of this project is to expand his business online, allowing customers to configure, price, and purchase custom bicycles through a dedicated website. The platform should replicate the flexibility of in-store customization, handle complex configuration rules and pricing dependencies, and allow Marcus to easily manage his product offerings, inventory, and pricing rules. While the initial focus is bicycles, the underlying platform should be designed with potential future expansion into other sports goods categories in mind.

**2. Goals & Objectives**

*   **Business Goals:**
    *   Establish an online sales channel for Marcus's Bicycle Shop.
    *   Increase overall sales revenue by reaching a wider customer base.
    *   Improve operational efficiency by streamlining the custom order process.
    *   Lay the foundation for future expansion into selling other customizable sports equipment.
*   **User Goals (Customers):**
    *   Easily discover and browse available bicycle configurations online.
    *   Intuitively customize a bicycle by selecting various parts and options.
    *   Receive real-time, accurate pricing based on selected customizations.
    *   Understand compatibility constraints between different parts during customization.
    *   Be informed about the availability (stock status) of specific parts/options.
    *   Successfully add a configured bicycle to a shopping cart for potential purchase.
*   **User Goals (Marcus - Admin):**
    *   Easily manage product categories (initially Bicycles, potentially others later).
    *   Define and manage customizable parts and their available options (e.g., Frame Type: Full-suspension, Diamond; Rim Color: Red, Black).
    *   Set base prices for individual part options.
    *   Define and manage complex compatibility rules between part options (e.g., "Mountain wheels" require "Full-suspension" frame).
    *   Define and manage conditional pricing rules (e.g., "Matte finish" price varies based on selected "Frame type").
    *   Update the stock status (available/out of stock) for individual part options.

**3. Target Audience / User Personas**

*   **Persona 1: The Customization Enthusiast (Customer)**
    *   *Description:* Tech-savvy individual, passionate about cycling, looking for a unique bike tailored to their specific needs (performance, aesthetics). Values detailed control over components.
    *   *Needs/Pain Points:* Finds standard off-the-shelf bikes limiting. Wants transparency in pricing during customization. Gets frustrated by incompatible parts or unclear availability after spending time configuring.
*   **Persona 2: Marcus (Shop Owner / Admin)**
    *   *Description:* Experienced bicycle mechanic and business owner. Deep knowledge of bicycles and customization possibilities/constraints. Wants to grow his business online but may have limited time for complex administrative tasks.
    *   *Needs/Pain Points:* Needs a system that accurately reflects his complex product offerings and pricing rules. Worried about selling configurations that are impossible to build or use out-of-stock parts. Requires an intuitive interface to manage products, rules, prices, and inventory without needing extensive technical knowledge.

**4. Use Cases / User Stories**

**Customer:**

*   **UC-01:** As a customer, I want to browse the available base bicycle models so that I can choose one to start customizing.
*   **UC-02:** As a customer, I want to select options for each available bicycle part (e.g., frame type, wheels, color) so that I can personalize my bike.
*   **UC-03:** As a customer, I want the customization interface to automatically disable or hide incompatible options based on my previous selections so that I don't accidentally create an impossible configuration.
*   **UC-04:** As a customer, I want to see the total price update in real-time as I make selections so that I understand the cost implications of my choices.
*   **UC-05:** As a customer, I want to clearly see if a specific part option (e.g., "Red Rim Color") is temporarily out of stock so that I don't select it or can choose an alternative.
*   **UC-06:** As a customer, after configuring my desired bicycle, I want to add it to a shopping cart so that I can proceed to checkout (checkout process itself is out of scope for V1 but the cart mechanism is needed).

**Admin (Marcus):**

*   **UC-07:** As Marcus, I want to log in to an admin panel so that I can manage my online store.
*   **UC-08:** As Marcus, I want to define a new product type (e.g., "Road Bike", "Mountain Bike" - initially just "Bicycle") so that I can organize my offerings.
*   **UC-09:** As Marcus, I want to define categories of customizable parts for a product type (e.g., "Frame", "Wheels", "Chain") so that customers can configure them.
*   **UC-10:** As Marcus, I want to add specific options within each part category (e.g., add "Carbon Fiber" to "Frame Type") and set their base price so that they are available for customer selection.
*   **UC-11:** As Marcus, I want to mark specific part options as "Temporarily Out of Stock" so that customers cannot select them for purchase.
*   **UC-12:** As Marcus, I want to define compatibility rules (e.g., "If Frame Type is 'Step-through', then Wheels cannot be 'Fat bike wheels'") so that only valid configurations can be created.
*   **UC-13:** As Marcus, I want to define conditional pricing rules (e.g., "Set price of 'Matte Finish' to 50 EUR if 'Frame Type' is 'Full-suspension', otherwise 35 EUR") so that pricing accurately reflects complex dependencies.
*   **UC-14:** As Marcus, I want to view and manage all defined parts, options, prices, stock levels, and rules so that I can maintain the accuracy of my online store.

**5. Functional Requirements**

**FR-01: Product Display & Browsing**
    *   FR-01.1: The website shall display available product types (initially focusing on Bicycles).
    *   FR-01.2: Each product (e.g., a customizable bicycle) shall have a dedicated product page.

**FR-02: Bicycle Customization Interface**
    *   FR-02.1: The product page shall present users with available categories of parts for customization (e.g., Frame Type, Frame Finish, Wheels, Rim Color, Chain).
    *   FR-02.2: For each part category, the interface shall display the available options (e.g., Frame Type: Full-suspension, Diamond, Step-through).
    *   FR-02.3: Users must be able to select one option from each mandatory part category.
    *   FR-02.4: The interface must dynamically update available options based on compatibility rules. If a selection makes another option invalid, the invalid option must be clearly indicated (e.g., greyed out, removed, marked as incompatible).
    *   FR-02.5: Part options marked as "Temporarily Out of Stock" by the admin must be clearly indicated and non-selectable by the customer.
    *   FR-02.6: The system shall display a visual representation or summary of the user's current selections. (Exact visualization TBD in design).

**FR-03: Dynamic Pricing Engine**
    *   FR-03.1: The system shall calculate a base price by summing the individual base prices of all selected part options.
    *   FR-03.2: The system shall apply defined conditional pricing rules, overriding or adjusting the base price as specified by the rules based on the combination of selected options.
    *   FR-03.3: The total calculated price, reflecting all selections and applicable rules, shall be displayed prominently and update in near real-time as the user makes changes.

**FR-04: Shopping Cart**
    *   FR-04.1: An "Add to Cart" button shall be present on the product customization page.
    *   FR-04.2: Clicking "Add to Cart" shall save the complete configuration (all selected part options) and the final calculated price as a distinct line item in the user's shopping cart.
    *   FR-04.3: The system must persist the cart contents (details TBD based on architecture - e.g., session, database if users log in).

**FR-05: Administration Panel**
    *   FR-05.1: A secure admin login interface for Marcus.
    *   FR-05.2: **Product Management:** Interface to define product types (e.g., Bicycle) and associate part categories with them.
    *   FR-05.3: **Part Category Management:** Interface to create, view, update, and delete part categories (e.g., Frame Type, Wheels).
    *   FR-05.4: **Part Option Management:** Interface to create, view, update, and delete specific options within categories (e.g., add "10-speed chain" to "Chain"), including setting a base price for each option.
    *   FR-05.5: **Inventory Management:** Interface to toggle the availability status ("In Stock" / "Temporarily Out of Stock") for each individual part option.
    *   FR-05.6: **Compatibility Rule Management:** An intuitive interface for Marcus to define rules that restrict combinations of options (e.g., If [Part A Option X] is selected, then [Part B Option Y] is unavailable). The system needs to support defining these dependencies.
    *   FR-05.7: **Conditional Pricing Rule Management:** An intuitive interface for Marcus to define rules that adjust pricing based on combinations of selected options (e.g., If [Part A Option X] AND [Part B Option Y] are selected, set price override for [Part A Option X] to Z EUR). The system needs to support defining these complex pricing adjustments.

**6. Non-Functional Requirements**

*   **NFR-01: Performance:** The customization interface and price calculation should respond quickly (ideally < 1 second update) to user selections to provide a smooth experience. Page load times should be optimized.
*   **NFR-02: Usability:**
    *   *Customer:* The customization process must be intuitive and easy to understand, even with complex rules. Error feedback (incompatible selections) must be clear.
    *   *Admin:* The admin panel must be easy for Marcus (potentially non-technical user) to navigate and manage products, parts, rules, and inventory.
*   **NFR-03: Reliability:** Price calculations and compatibility rule enforcement must be accurate and consistent. The system should reliably prevent ordering of out-of-stock or incompatible configurations.
*   **NFR-04: Scalability:** While starting with bicycles, the underlying data model and architecture should ideally accommodate adding new product types (skis, surfboards) with their own distinct sets of customizable parts and rules in the future without requiring a complete redesign. The system should handle a reasonable increase in traffic and product complexity.
*   **NFR-05: Maintainability:** The system for defining and managing rules (compatibility and pricing) should be designed such that developers or potentially Marcus can update or add new rules without excessive complexity.
*   **NFR-06: Security:** Standard web security practices must be implemented for the admin login and any data persistence. (Further security requirements for payment processing will be defined when checkout is scoped).

**7. Design & UX Considerations**

*   The customization interface should provide clear visual feedback to the user about their selections and the resulting price.
*   Invalid or unavailable options should be clearly differentiated from available ones.
*   Consider using visual cues (images of parts, if possible) to aid the customization process, though this might be a future enhancement.
*   The admin interface should prioritize clarity and ease of use for managing potentially complex rule sets. Tooltips or help text may be necessary.

**8. Success Metrics / Release Criteria**

*   **Success Metrics:**
    *   Conversion Rate (Users completing customization and adding to cart).
    *   Cart Abandonment Rate (During customization phase).
    *   Task Success Rate (Admin): Time taken for Marcus to add a new part option, define a new compatibility rule, or update stock status.
    *   Reduction in manual order correction/clarification compared to offline process (qualitative feedback from Marcus).
    *   Online Sales Volume / Revenue.
*   **Release Criteria (MVP):**
    *   Customers can fully customize a bicycle selecting from predefined parts and options.
    *   Compatibility rules (as defined by Marcus for initial launch) correctly restrict selections.
    *   Pricing accurately reflects base prices and defined conditional pricing rules.
    *   Out-of-stock options are non-selectable.
    *   Configured bicycles can be successfully added to the shopping cart.
    *   Marcus can log in and perform all admin functions defined in FR-05 for bicycles.
    *   Core non-functional requirements (Performance, Usability, Reliability) are met for the defined scope.

**9. Future Considerations / Out of Scope (for V1)**

*   **Out of Scope (V1):**
    *   Full checkout process (payment gateway integration, shipping calculation, order placement).
    *   User accounts for customers (saving configurations, order history).
    *   Order management system in the admin panel.
    *   Support for product types other than Bicycles (though architecture should consider it).
    *   Advanced search or filtering of products.
    *   Customer reviews or ratings.
    *   Detailed analytics dashboard beyond basic metrics.
    *   Product imagery dynamically changing based on selections (complex).
*   **Future Considerations:**
    *   Implement full e-commerce checkout flow.
    *   Add support for other product types (skis, surfboards, etc.) with their own customization rules.
    *   Introduce customer accounts.
    *   Develop a more visual configuration tool.
    *   Integrate with inventory management systems (if Marcus uses one).

**10. Open Questions & Assumptions**

*   **Assumptions:**
    *   The initial launch will focus *exclusively* on customizable bicycles.
    *   Marcus will be responsible for inputting and maintaining all product data, rules, prices, and stock information via the admin panel.
    *   The definition of "product" (e.g., is "Bicycle" the product, or are specific models like "Mountain Bike X" the product to be customized?) needs clarification, assumed here as a general "Bicycle" product type for V1.
    *   Basic shopping cart functionality (add/view/remove item) is sufficient for V1, without requiring user login.
    *   The technical team will propose a suitable data model and architecture to support the required flexibility in rules and future product types (as requested in the code exercise part of the original prompt).
*   **Open Questions:**
    *   What are the specific, exhaustive lists of parts, options, compatibility rules, and pricing rules needed for the initial bicycle launch? (The examples provided are incomplete).
    *   Are there any specific performance benchmarks required (e.g., max response time for price updates)?
    *   Are there any existing brand guidelines or design preferences for the website?
    *   What are the requirements for hosting, deployment, and ongoing maintenance?
    *   Will placeholder images be used initially, or are actual component images required?
    *   How should multiple items of the *same* complex configuration be handled in the cart? (Allow quantity change, or force re-adding?)
    *   What level of detail is needed for persisting the cart configuration (e.g., just the selected option IDs, or a full snapshot of names/prices at the time of adding)?
